## About

BuildStream is an integration build system.
It models dependencies at a project level, enabling projects to use their own underlying build system.
It is a Remote Execution client, that distributes builds at the project level.
The BuildStream implementation uses Remote Execution concepts directly, even for local builds.

BuildStream supports multiple build-systems (e.g. autotools, cmake, cpan, distutils, make, meson, qmake, pip)
through its plugins.
