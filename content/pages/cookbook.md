title: Cookbook @ Apache Petri
<!-- Licensed under ALv2 -->
## Petri Cookbook

During its time in Petri a culture may go through a number of transitions. We track these on a web page.

### About

This section should describe the project.
Whenever a community begins to call itself Apache Foo then it needs to provide a DISCLAIMER. Contact discuss@petri.apache.org for the text.

### Website

Provide the current website for the project community. When the community wishes Petri will guide in the creation of a website on Apache Infrastructure.

### Mailing Lists

List the mailing lists used by the community. Petri will create Apache Mailing lists when requested.

### Source Code Repository

Provide the url to the source code repository. Petri will request an Apache Git repository when the community is ready to migrate.
This will require an SGA be filed (See below.)

If a different type of repository is required then please discuss with your Mentors.

### Issue Tracker

Provide the address to your issue tracker. The ASF offers both JIRA and GitHub issue trackers. Bugzilla is also an option for older projects.

### Wiki

Provide the address to your project wiki, if any. The ASF offers both Confluence and GitHub wikis.
Other Wikis would require other support which should be discussed with your mentors.

### Releases (not Apache)

The URL where project releases can be found. The assumption is that releases will not be Apache releases until late in the process.
Once an Apache Release has been made then the "not" can be struck.

### Licensing Transitions

The community needs to undertake some license transitions if their intent is to become an Apache PMC (TLP).
