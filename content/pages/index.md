The Apache Petri (as in “petri dish” –where cultures are grown and bloom) committee
assists external project communities interested in becoming an Apache project to
learn how The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) works, its views on community, and
how to build a healthy community for the long -term.

Petri’s mission is to mentor existing external communities (“cultures”) about
“The Apache Way” by focusing on community governance that includes discussions
about ASF policies. The mentoring and education is conducted on a mailing list.

The primary goal is to reach a point where a recommendation to the ASF Board can
be made to construct a new Apache Project Management Committee (PMC) for the
external community.
